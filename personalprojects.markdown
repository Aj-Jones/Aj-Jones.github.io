>**Liar's Dice** was a side project that myself and a buddy worked on that was a fantastic opportunity to learn and develop skills throughout the entire spectrum of game development. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While working on this project, I gained experience in both Client and Server side logic. On the client side, I created the UI and worked on responding to changes in the game state, and presenting that in a clear manner, as well as making it aesthetically pleasing. Server side was much more involved, as we built out Matchmaking, Bots, and the game logic itself. Additionally, we wanted to be able to test in a quick and efficient manner, so we built tools to automatically build out the server and run an instance, as well as an automated client that connects and plays the game against bots. This offered us the opportunity for much more efficient testing, and we were able to cut down development time greatly. Lastly, I configured a Linux instance to best suit our needs for a game server. On boot, the server application will startup, and if at any point we are unable to communicate with the server (i.e. crashes/internet outage) I setup a notification that gets sent to my email, and through a text message. Overall, this project allowed me to take a project from start to finish and learn not only how to make the game, but how to make tools required as well, while optimizing my workflow.
