**Celia's Lightmare** was my most recent submission to Ludum Dare, placing 164th overall, based on the theme "Start With Nothing". Our goal was a atmospheric shooter that had a fun gameplay loop. Each time you collect enough power from the enemies, you can respawn with a multiplier, but lose everything else "Starting with Nothing". Each time you respawn the enemies get tougher. This entry was a great exercise in project management, event driven UI programming, and creating a gamestate that could be easily manipulated.

## Ludum Dare 43, ImminENT Danger

**ImminiENT Danger** was based on the theme of Sacrifices Must Be Made.
Each time you find yourself too surrounded to continue, you could wave your torch to kill all enemies on screen, at the cost of your view range and avalible light. This was a fun entry that allowed us to work on enemy AI, world generation, and optimization for browsers.

## Ludum Dare 40

**Extreme Wizard Karts** Was my first game jam. I was still very new to Unity and devlopment in general, but had a great time working on it. The theme for this jam was, "The more you have, the worse it is". So for every lap you complete, a ghost driver drives your path in reverse. Don't get hit! This project got me comfortable with data structure manipulation, as I had to store positional data for the player at different intervals, and then feed it back to AI Ghost drivers in reverse.
