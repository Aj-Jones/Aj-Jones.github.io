>### 2020 -> 2023
><a href="https://www.welltold.games/the-foglands">![Foglands](/assets/img/foglands.png)
>The Foglands is an atmospheric roguelike adventure where youâ€™ll discover new paths, and uncover old secrets. 
>Run into the unknown, fight monsters, scavenge loot, and try to make it back before you are swallowed by the Fog.
>The Foglands can be played in VR or First Person, and is available on both Sony PSVR2 and the Meta Quest.

Working on **The Foglands** as Lead Engineer was an incredible experience. Getting to work alongside the development of the PSVR2 while also supporting the Meta Quest was both challenging and rewarding.

# Legendary DXP & Legendary DXP: 007
>### 2018-2020

> Legendary DXP is a digital version of the tabletop card game Legendary. Play against friends, foes, or AI in this deck building card game.</a>

**Legendary DXP** was the start of my game development career. It was a great opportunity to start learning more aspects of game development outside programming within an engine, such as client server architecture, Node.js, and SQL databases.
I started off helping solve bugs related to desynchronization between the client and server, and quickly moved on to helping build a bug resolution process, creating tools to check and report server status, and eventually working on the foundations for Legendary DXP: 007. During this time, I gained the experience of working on a multi-platform live service game which included the following aspects.
- Server side logic for the core functionality of the game.
- Client side logic for client interaction and rendering of the game state.
- Tool and Process creation for better management of bugs.
- Product submission to various storefronts, live-ops, and overall project support.
- Customer Support
- Database management

# Dr Seuss Simulator 
>### 2020
><a href="https://www.seussville.com/dr-seuss-simulator-game-on-roblox/">![Dr Seuss Simulator](/assets/img/drseuss.png)
> Dr Suess Simulator was a licensed Roblox experience for the Dr Seuss Enterprises.</a>

While working on Legendary DXP, I was offered some aditional contracting work for **Dr Seuss Simulator**. I worked on setting up the IAP system and save data management, as well as providing gameplay scripting support. It was a great learning experience in working with a third party API and designing flexible data organization for use with limited API calls. It also helped re-enforce how to design code for client/server architecture.
