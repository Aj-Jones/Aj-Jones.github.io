><a href="https://www.welltold.games/the-foglands">![Foglands](/assets/img/foglands.png)</a>
>The Foglands is an atmospheric roguelike adventure where youâ€™ll discover new paths, and uncover old secrets. 
>Run into the unknown, fight monsters, scavenge loot, and try to make it back before you are swallowed by the Fog.
>The Foglands can be played in VR or First Person, and is available on both Sony PSVR2 and the Meta Quest.

Working on **The Foglands** as Lead Engineer was an incredible experience. Getting to work alongside the development of the PSVR2 was a rewarding and challenging experience.

> Legendary DXP is a digital version of the tabletop card game Legendary. Play against friends, foes, or AI in this deck building card game.

**Legendary DXP** was the start of my game development career. It was a great opportunity to start learning more aspects of game development outside programming within an engine.
