>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Feed Hole** was my most recent submission to Ludum Dare, and was a fantastic chance to work with some friends. The theme was "Keep it alive" and we decided the best way to do that, was feeding power cores to a sentient AI.  This project offered so many different things to work on and learn from. We created our own base class, and defined specific update loops for different types of entities. This allowed us to manage the lifecylce of objects much more specifically, and was a great lesson in game state and overall structure. Additionally, I got to experiment with some procedural animation, and work with our sound guy to implement FMOD into the project. Lastly, getting it compressed and working decently on WebGL (within the jam window) was an awesome challenge at the finish line.

## Celia's Lightmare, Ludum Dare 45

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Celia's Lightmare** was a super enjoyable LD submission, placing 164th overall, based on the theme "Start With Nothing". Our goal was a atmospheric shooter that had a fun gameplay loop. Each time you collect enough power from the enemies, you can respawn with a multiplier, but lose everything else "Starting with Nothing". Each time you respawn the enemies get tougher. This entry was a great exercise in project management, event driven UI programming, and creating a gamestate that could be easily manipulated.

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**ImminiENT Danger** was based on the theme of Sacrifices Must Be Made.
Each time you find yourself too surrounded to continue, you could wave your torch to kill all enemies on screen, at the cost of your view range and avalible light. This was a fun entry that allowed us to work on enemy AI, world generation, and optimization for browsers.

## Extreme Wizard Karts, Ludum Dare 40

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Extreme Wizard Karts** Was my first game jam. I was still very new to Unity and devlopment in general, but had a great time working on it. The theme for this jam was, "The more you have, the worse it is". So for every lap you complete, a ghost driver drives your path in reverse. Don't get hit! This project got me comfortable with data structure manipulation, as I had to store positional data for the player at different intervals, and then feed it back to AI Ghost drivers in reverse.
